    <p>Welcome to Wild Rescue. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate,
        and release wildlife back into their natural environment. We are a 
        nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>

        also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released back 
        into their natural enviroment. </p>
